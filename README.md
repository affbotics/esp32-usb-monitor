# esp32-usb-monitor

This project implements a GUD (Graphics USB Display) driver for the ESP32-S3 microcontroller from Espressif. The code has been ported from the original repository [notro/gud-pico](https://github.com/notro/gud-pico/tree/main).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the code:

1. Install ESP-IDF v5.1 by referring to the [official ESP-IDF documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/).

2. Optionally, you can install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for a more convenient development experience.

3. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

4. Set up the Environment Variables for ESP-IDF.

5. Set the IDF target to ESP32-S3 by running the following command:
   ```
   idf.py set-target esp32s3
   ```

6. Build the code using the following command:
   ```
   idf.py build
   ```

7. Flash the program to your ESP32-S3:
   ```
   idf.py flash
   ```

8. Connect the ESP32-S3 to an **ili9340-based** TFT LCD display using the provided pinout, you can use ESP32-S3 DevKitC 1:


| TFT LCD Connection | ESP32-S3 GPIO |
|--------------------|--------------|
| SCK                | GPIO 7       |
| SDI (MOSI)         | GPIO 6       |
| CS                 | GPIO 11      |
| DC                 | GPIO 12      |
| Reset              | GPIO 47      |
| Backlight          | GPIO 48      |
| USB D-             | GPIO 19      |
| USB D+             | GPIO 20      |


9. Connect the ESP32-S3 to a PC's USB port with a GUD driver using GPIO 19 (D-) and GPIO 20 (D+). The ESP32-S3 should show up as a GUD USB display.
